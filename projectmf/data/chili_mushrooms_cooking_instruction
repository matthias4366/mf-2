Step 1:

Cook the beans in an electric pressure for 2 hours at the bean setting (117 degrees Celsius) with 4 ml of water per 1 g of beans. 

Step 2:

Turn the pressure cooker off. Drain the beans. Put the beans back in the electric pressure cooker. Add the tomato puree, chili powder, oregano and mushrooms. Set the pressure cooker to slow cook (100 degrees Celsius) and cook it for 1 hour.

Step 3:

Transfer the chili to another container. Wash the inner pot. Fill the inner pot with rice and water. Use a ratio of 1.4 ml of water per 1 g of white rice.

The base ratio is 1 ml of water per 1 g of white rice. Add water to offset evaporation in the cooking process. The evaporation water will be different for each pot, so experiment to find a ratio that makes the rice neither mushy nor burns it.

After cooking the rice, mix it with the chili.

Eat the following foods seperately: pea protein powder, flax seeds and vitamin tablets.
