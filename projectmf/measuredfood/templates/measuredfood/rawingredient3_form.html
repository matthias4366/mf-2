{# Design choices:   #}
{# Make one column with the field name on the left, and one column with the field on the right.   #}
{# Forget about putting the unit field next to the amount field. It is work, and it is not good for mobile users.   #}
{# Changes to be made:   #}
{# The users need to easily see which field name belongs to which form field.   #}
{# The column with the form fields should start right where the column with the field names stop.   #}
{# The excessive nutrients need to be removed. #}
{# The nutrients need to be divided into sections, such as Vitamins etc.   #}
{# The field names need to be changed to be more understable:   #}
{# Use nutrient_name or nutrient_name + 'unit' for the USDA nutrients.   #}
