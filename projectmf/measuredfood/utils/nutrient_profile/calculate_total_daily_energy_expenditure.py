    Researchers have determined a set of â€œactivity multipliers, known as 
    the Katch-McArdle multipliers.

To calculate your approximate TDEE, simply multiply these activity factors by 
your BMR:

    Sedentary (little to no exercise + work a desk job) = 1.2
    Lightly Active (light exercise 1-3 days / week) = 1.375
    Moderately Active (moderate exercise 3-5 days / week) = 1.55
    Very Active (heavy exercise 6-7 days / week) = 1.725
    Extremely Active (very heavy exercise, hard labor job, training 2x / day) 
    = 1.9
